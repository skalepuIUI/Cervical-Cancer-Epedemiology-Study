Cervical Cancer Epidemiology: Insights into Hormonal Contraceptives, IUD, and Age
# Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning üß¨

This project focuses on building predictive models for identifying individuals at risk of developing cervical cancer. Using a real-world dataset and Python-based analysis, the notebook walks through preprocessing, feature selection, and classification using multiple models including **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.

## üß† Problem Statement

Early detection of cervical cancer risk is crucial for effective prevention and treatment. This project aims to use machine learning algorithms to classify patients as high- or low-risk based on input health and behavior indicators.

## üîç What‚Äôs Inside

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Normalized input features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized distributions and correlations
   - Investigated risk factors using statistical summaries

3. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression: to understand interpretable associations
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM): for robust classification
   - Evaluated model accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision/recall

4. **Results Interpretation**
   - Compared performance across models
   - Discussed clinical relevance and possible next steps
